# Zusier-Client
Before I begin, This is a fork of CClientX and up to 99% of this is Cuffuffles work, So please check his out. Because Cuff is going for a more Proffesional look from now on, I'm going to keep that nice, MSPaint feeling (though im using photoshop) + The Zero Two Best Girl shit.

# Installation
Note: If you expect cloning the source code is gonna get you anywhere close to getting the client, it isnt. Unless you know how to compile it.

Windows Has Been the only one tested, honestly too lazy to get a mac Virtual Machine and run it and linux I have a VM for but I also can't passthrough my gpu so It will be VIRTUALLY impossible (hehe get it... kill me already)

 The MacNoCustomFix is regular CCX but for mac, I've been in contact with Cuffuffles and he is adding it to his repo.
 
 # Disclaimer 
 This disclaimer is about infections, malware and the chance this could be a virus/backdoored.
 As the creator (not of the fork, not the client) there can be a huge chance this is any sort of virus, keyloggers, RAT, ransomware etc. This is why it's open source. I'm leaving a VT scan for the .zip of each (no other way as its not an aio program like every other client.
